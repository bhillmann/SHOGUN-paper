## Abstract {.page_break_before}

SHOGUN is a software pipeline for simultaneous taxonomic and functional abundance profiling of metagenomics datasets with Bayesian redistribution of ambiguous mapping. The pipeline is built in a modular fashion so that it may be run in its entirety or indivual parts may be flexible allowing for user creation of a reference database and selection of the alignment tool that best fits a given users data and computational resources. The package allows users to efficiently go from quality-controlled sequences to abundance profiles consistently and accurately, enabling reproducible metagenomic sequencing research.


## Manubot Rootstock Information

**Note: Manubot instances should delete this file.**

The Manubot is a system for automating scholarly publishing.
Content is written in [Pandoc Markdown](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) source files.
See [`USAGE.md`](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock/blob/master/USAGE.md) for more information on how to use the Manubot.

The Manubot project began with the [Deep Review](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review), where it was used to compose a highly-collaborative review article [@tJKvnIaZ].
Other manuscripts that were created with Manubot include:

+ Michael Zietz's Report for the Vagelos Scholars Program ([GitHub](https://github.com/zietzm/Vagelos2017), [HTML manuscript](https://zietzm.github.io/Vagelos2017/)) [@15nwuvjrA]

If you notice a problem with Manubot, it's best to submit an upstream fix to the appropriate repository:
[`greenelab/manubot-rootstock`](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock) for the git repository stub or [`greenelab/manubot`](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot) for the Python package.
